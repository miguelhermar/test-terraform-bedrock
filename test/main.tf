Based on the provided architecture diagram and requirements, here's the Terraform code to create an Amazon S3 bucket:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "testing_bucket" {
  bucket = "testing-bucket-4100000"
  acl    = "private"

  server_side_encryption_configuration {
    rule {
      apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
        sse_algorithm = "AES256"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This Terraform code creates an Amazon S3 bucket named "testing-bucket-4100000" in the "us-east-1" region. The bucket is set to private access control list (ACL), and server-side encryption is enabled with the AES256 algorithm, as per the requirements.

Since no other resources or dependencies are mentioned in the architecture diagram, no additional Terraform code is provided. However, if you need to create other resources like VPCs, subnets, EC2 instances, or RDS instances, you can use the recommended Terraform module sources mentioned in the requirements.

For example, to create a VPC using the `terraform-aws-vpc` module, you can add the following code:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"

  name = "my-vpc"
  cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"

  azs             = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]
  private_subnets = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24", "10.0.3.0/24"]
  public_subnets  = ["10.0.101.0/24", "10.0.102.0/24", "10.0.103.0/24"]

  enable_nat_gateway = true
  enable_vpn_gateway = true

  tags = {
    Terraform = "true"
    Environment = "dev"
  }
}
```

This code creates a VPC with public and private subnets, NAT gateways, and a VPN gateway using the `terraform-aws-vpc` module. You can customize the module configuration as per your requirements.
